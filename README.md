# Baking Time Project Submission By Jasdeep Singh

## Project Overview
Waheguru ji
This is submission project code which is part of [udacity android developer course](https://in.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801).
The **Baking time** app shows a list of recipes, curated by Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, and shows step wise instruction for each recipe when selected.

## Why this Project?
As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.

By building this app, one can demonstrate understanding of the foundational elements of programming for Android. 
The app communicates with the Internet and provides a responsive and delightful user experience.

## What I learnt?
Through this project, I learnt to:

- Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
- Handle error cases in Android.
- Add a widget to your app experience.
- Leverage a third-party library in app.
- Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
